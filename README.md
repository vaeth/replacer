Search and replace python regular expressions within many files interactively

The aim of the project is to replace regular expressions interactively
in a collection of files.

Its functionality is similar to the perl script `plrep` from
https://github.com/vaeth/mv_perl/
as well as to the ancient python script
https://github.com/vaeth/pyrep/
In a sense, it can be considered a successor of both projects,
also properly dealing with replacements of expressions over multiple lines.
(In the previous projects, multiple lines had only been rudimentarily
implemented or not at all, respectively.)

To install this script, just copy the content of bin/ into your `$PATH`.
To get zsh completion, copy the content of zsh/ to your zsh's `$fpath`,
perhaps `/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/`.

If you have gettext installed, you can also install translations:
To install the translation catalogue use the command `po/install-mo ""`
(omit the `""` to get help about the command).
For testing, you can set REPLACER_NLS or NLS to the catalogue path.
For installation, it is recommended to adapt the line
localedir = '' in bin/replacer appropriately.

The script executes just `python` and is tested with python2.7 and python3.6,
but it should work with all flavors of python3 and probably also some older
versions of python2. Some details on codings and regular expressions might
depend on the python interpreter, so it might be advisable to specify
a specific interpreter in front of the command line (if in doubt try the
newest available) if things are not working the way you expect.

Under windows, it might be necessary to either have the colorama package
installed or to enable ANSI color emulation or to disable colors
with --colors=none to get readable output.

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the `mv` repository
(available by `app-select/eselect-repository` or `app-portage/layman`).
